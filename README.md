## Description
- The motivation for this project was being able to use inquirer as a useful question tool for developers, using this tool to create a file.
- The purpose of this project was to show I can create a functional app that is capable of producing an html page for a workforce portfolio.
- This solves the issue of simplifying the process of normally tedious things.
- I have learned that coders are lazy.
